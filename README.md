Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.facebook.com/francisjules.celeste">Francis Jules Espartero</a> you can call me 'France', a passionate self-taught  web developer my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.



graduated in ISAT U (Iloilo Science and Technology University) taking Computer Science Degree, i'm also very curious about how technolgoy works way back in 2016. Technology gives me a different feeling of excitement knowing we are evolving more and more.
